This project is a fully funcional food ordering system made in django.
Beside python I did use bootstrap 4 for better control of all DOMs elements.

Program automatically create superuser account at first start

My personal touch allowing site administrator to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders
